## JavaScript Movie Fight App

This APP was inspired by an exercise proposed in "The Modern Javascript Bootcamp" course by Colt Steele and Stephen Grider.

Here I preset my own version of the project developed by the instructor. I coded before the instruction and at the end made some changes and improvements based on the instruction.
I also added some extra features and solved some minor bugs present in the original project.

Extra features
(1) Message after comparison of movies: If wins = "WINS!" for the winner movie. If draw = "DRAW!" for both movies.
(2) Comparison of a different color (grey) if values can't be compared, eg: if values are "N/A", or "Unknown", or "Undefined".
(3) Alert Message if user tray to submit an invalid input after pressing the "Enter" key.
(4) Alert Message hides if search input blurs or the user makes a valid choice from the dropdown menu.  
(3) Fetch request starts only after a certain input length (helps to reduce request number).
(4) Tutorial animation on close.

This project was a good opportunity for practicing API get requests, reusable code, and OOP.
In order to practice CSS, I also worked on the styling development without the BULMA CSS framework used by the instructor. It also was nice for learning a bit more about animations.
