## JavaScript Timer App

Exercise proposed in "The Modern Javascript Bootcamp" course by Colt Steele and Stephen Grider.

Here I preset my approach to solve some bugs of the app founded in the code presented by the instructor.

(1) Timer countdown animation starts at the same place when paused (fixed).
(2) Input limit length (fixed).
(3) Input accept only numbers (fixed).
(4) Added reset btn.
(5) Added animation after countdown is over.

In order to practice CSS, I also worked on the styling developing it a bit further than the original one. It was nice to learn a bit more about svg and animations.
