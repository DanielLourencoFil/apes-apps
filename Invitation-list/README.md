## JavaScript Invitation List App

Project inspired by an exercise in "JavaScript Dynamic Web Pages AJAX 30 Projects APIs JSON
" course by Laurence Svekis.

The idea of this app came up while doing a TODO list (one among many). I tried to build something a bit more meaningfull than a just another instance of the very cliche TODO list.

Obviouslly it needs a styling improvent (I'll do it who knows when...)
